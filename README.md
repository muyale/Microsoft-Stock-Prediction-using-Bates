Using Bates and Laguerre polynomials in financial modelling


# Financial Modeling with Bates Model and Laguerre Polynomials

This project implements a financial modeling framework using the Bates model for stochastic volatility and jumps in asset prices, along with Laguerre polynomials for approximating the continuation value function in options pricing.

## Overview

Financial modeling plays a crucial role in understanding market dynamics and making informed investment decisions. The Bates model extends the Black-Scholes model to incorporate stochastic volatility and jumps in asset prices, providing a more realistic representation of market behavior. Laguerre polynomials are used to approximate the continuation value function in options pricing, allowing for efficient and accurate pricing of financial derivatives.

## Bates Model

The Bates model is defined by the following equations:

- Stochastic Differential Equation for the Asset Price:

  $\[
  \frac{{dS_t}}{{S_t}} = (r - \lambda_t \cdot \mu)dt + \sqrt{v_t}dW_t^1
  \]$

- Stochastic Differential Equation for the Variance:

  $\[
  dv_t = \kappa_v(\theta_v - v_t)dt + \sigma_v\sqrt{v_t}dZ_t^2
  \]$

- Poisson Process for Jumps:

  $\[
  N_t \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_tdt)
  \]$

- Total Variance:

  $\[
  v_t = v_{t-1} + dv_t + \sum_{i=1}^{N_t} J_{t,i}
  \]$

## Laguerre Polynomials

The Laguerre polynomials are a set of orthogonal polynomials that can be used to approximate the continuation value function in options pricing. The Laguerre polynomials \( L_k(x) \) are defined by the following recursive formula:

- $\( L_0(x) = 1 \)
- $\( L_1(x) = 1 - x \)
- $\( L_{k+1}(x) = \frac{{(2k + 1 - x)L_k(x) - kL_{k-1}(x)}}{{k+1}} \)

## Features
